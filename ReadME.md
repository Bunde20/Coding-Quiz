# Coding Quiz

## Client Needs:
- Create a functional quiz with code related questions that stores the user's highscores for viewing.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- When the start button is selected the timer should start counting down and a question should be displayed.
    - To fulfill this, there is a start button on the opening page of the quiz that will initialize the start of the quiz, which displays a questions and starts a timer countdown.
- When a question is answered, another question should render for the user to answer.
    - This was done by dynamically creating a function to display a new question every time one is answered.
- If a question is answered incorrectly time should be subtracted from the clock.
    - This criteria was met by displaying a message that indicated the answer was incorrect and it reduces the timer by 10 seconds.
- The game should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 seconds.
    - When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the user is prompted with a screen displaying their score and gives them the opportunity to enter their initials to save it for future reference.
